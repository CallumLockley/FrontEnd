### What my site is about
My site is based around the rules and regulations of football as well as the governing bodies that help oversee it. Focusing on 2 particular laws, Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct and Law 5 - The Referee giving the basic information from the official laws of the game posted on the [FA's website](https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules).

Implementing Guardian's API [Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) to retrieve news articles that are related to football. Providing users with the headline, thumbnail and the posted date for each. With a link that can redirect the user to the original post upon the Guardian's website.

### Target Audience
Allowing easy to access information regarding laws and organisations it targets those who are interested in football or those who are wanting to help gain a basic understanding of the influences on football and some of its rules and regulations.
Organised in a way that breaks down each law separately and organisations, giving their basic purpose for what they do. With specific law information being simplistic as possible to be easy to read and understand.

### Display Organisation

Completing a mobile first design allows the website to accommodate multiple screen sizes, making use of media queries to alter properties, allowing tailored solutions for certain sizes.

Such as when viewing news articles on a mobile sizes screen these are shown within a single column. When moving to a larger screen this alters to move the articles into 3 columns to make use of the space. Each row being giving an alternate colour for better segregation.

When navigating down the screen, once a certain amount has been scrolled down a back to top button appears. Giving the user the ability to easily return to the top of the current page.
