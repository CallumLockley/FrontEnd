				<div class="fk-types">
					<h2>Indirect Free Kicks</h2>
					<p class="sub">These are awarded for the following:</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="fouls">
					<li>Playing in dangerous manner</li>
					<li>Impeding without contact</li>
					<li>Discent, using offensive, insulting or abusive language or actions</li>

			<section id="handling">
				<div class="">
					<h2>Handling the Ball</h2>
					<p class="sub">This is defined by the bottom of the player's armpit. Not every touch is an offence.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="sub">Offence when a player:</p>
				<ul class="fouls">
					<li>Deliberately touching the ball with their hand/arm: moving this towards the ball</li>
					<li>Making their body unnaturally bigger, that isn't justifiable by movement for the given situation.</li>
					<li>Scores a goal through handling the ball</li>
					<li>Directly from their hand/arm, even accidental, including the goalkeeper</li>
					<li>Immediately after the ball has touch their hand/arm</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="handling">Goalkeepers are under the same restrictions when outside their penalty area. If handling within their penalty area when not allowed to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but no disciplinary action is taken. Unless it is for playing the ball a second time after a restart before touching another player, they must be sanctioned if the offence stops a promising attack or denies an opponent or the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.</p>
